# Getting and cleaning data

This repository was created for the submission of the course project.

##Overview

The repository contains 3 files:
1. tidyDataset.txt : output file
2. README.md : explaination of repository and basic overview of the project
3. CodeBook.md : describes the variables of the tidyDataset.txt

##Project Summary

The summary description consists of the steps which had to be taken. 
Explained in the course instruction provided by Coursera.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
